# CoolProjects
Various projects using common technologies. Some descriptions:
- Music - Collects songs from Wikipedia pages (using Selenium), gets information about them from YouTube and Spotify (using Selenium and API endpoints), shuffles the list in a custom manner and adds the shuffled songs to a Spotify playlist.

- LeagueAPI - Recursively scans games from player accounts (starting from my own account) and, when finished, uses the scanned data to create Excel spreadsheets containing statistics on various game components.

- CoolProjectsAPI – an API which provides endpoints to use function in the Music and LeagueAPI projects, hosted on a local instance of IIS.

- Selenium_Flights – Builds a collection of airports and all their destinations (using Selenium and FlightsFrom.com) and can print all paths possible from one airport to another. Each path can be opened in Google Flight/Skyscanner tabs.

- ExRxDotNet – scans pages of the given website and presents a json that can be used to pick out exercises.

- ClassLibrary – contains classes shared between projects (such as parent classes and extension functions).
